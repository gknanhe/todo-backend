# Todo APP API

This is the backend server for the Todo App, providing APIs for managing user tasks and authentication.
It allows the users) to register and log in, register , and create todos . It also provides endpoints to retrieve all todos , filtered by status.
The API is built using Node.js and MongoDB, and uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. The folder structure is organized into models, controllers, and routes for scalability and maintainability.
